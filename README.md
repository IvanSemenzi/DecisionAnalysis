# DecisionAnalysis

Python implementation of the exercises of the course of "Decision Analysis" held during the A.A. 2022-2023.

The directory <em>MatlabCode</em> contains the official Matlab code provided by the professor during the lessons, while <em>PythonCode</em> contains the respective Python implementations. The <em>environment.yml</em> file contains all the packages that were used in these scripts and provide an easy way to create an identical Anaconda virtual environment to the one we used to run them.

<strong>THE CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY WAS WRITTEN FROM STUDENTS AND WAS NOT VALIDATED FROM PROFESSOR YET.</strong>
